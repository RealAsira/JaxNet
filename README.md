# An EC:Pages Website - The JaxNet Project

## JaxNet Webserver/site and TSQL Database Project

### Summary

JaxNet is a webserver/database platform aimed at building and deploying a secure, modular, and efficient network of web-based services and applications. It leverages a custom web-language, [EC:Pages](https://github.com/realasira/ecpages), alongside widely-used web technologies like SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, enabling seamless data integration and dynamic user interfaces. The primary goal of JaxNet is to streamline the development of scalable database-driven applications with enhanced reliability and security. This project focuses on minimizing deployment complexity and improving maintainability by creating a centralized, adaptable infrastructure for web development needs.
