# Project History (Before Git Was Being Used)

The workplace that introduced me to EC:Pages (and subsequently resulted in the JaxNet project) used different methodology for version control (ie extensive backups and note-taking). Initially, this project utilized a more detailed version approach of this same methodology.

Now, the project is being moved to Git and GitHub, though the project is also not being actively developed or worked on. However, it is still one of the largest, single projects Asira has worked on. Fairly extensive documentation has been kept, starting shortly after the foundation for the project was laid. This file contains this history, chronologically ordered.

## History Begins Here

Not yet added, I'm actively compiling the history list from a series of KB documents stored utilizing the KB engine built using this very project.
